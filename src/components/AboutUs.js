      The Sydney Guitar Collective is an initiative of Dr Janet Agostino, the Guitar
Collectiveâ€™s musical director, who has worked with the UNSW Guitar Ensemble 
over the last ten years. The Collective was established in early 2023
with the aim to provide a platform for guitar ensemble performance for a group of
young, motivated musicians who met through their studies at UNSW. The
Collective brings a diverse repertoire to their performances and aims to expand 
this predominantly Australian repertoire through commissioning new
works from colleagues and associates.
The Collective acknowledges the significant support and sponsorship from
Dr. Simon Powis of Classical Guitar Corner, to whom we are enormously
grateful.
